<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In the 2019 election, the survey showed that the support for the Liberal and Conservative Party are approximately the same. Among those group people, I mainly focus the variable of year of birth and the federal party that they support.</p>
<p>In the graph, one thing that we can conclude is that the survey focused more on the people who are 40 years old or more and the statistics itself is biased.</p>
<p>After the graph, there will be a general discussion and the weakness that we encountered in this survey.</p>
